# Eat2Gather
## Made with PHP, MySQL

** Service discontinued

### Background
This application was developed for the **[IE261] Information Technology for Industrial Engineering** class in the 2017 fall semester at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), taught by Professor Hyo-Won Suh.
The application was created by students Jae Sung Park and Duman Kuandyk.

### Motivation
In many cultures around the world, eating is traditioinally an enjoyable daily ritual where people take a break from their busy days to gather with family and friends. However, for many university students, there is an increasing trend of "Honbap" (혼밥), a newly formed word to define the phenomenon of eating alone. Especially in universities, this phenomenon is highly prevalent. Just walk into any cafeteria and the evidence is all there. Through extensive surveys and interviews, we found the difficulty that comes with organizing a group of people to eat together was the main cause. University students simply don't have the time to organize such groups every day. A simple application to allow students to easily create or join groups to eat together with a simple click of a button was needed.

### Data Collection
The application was specifically designed to target KAIST undergraduate students. Data collection was done through an extensive interview and survey process with 30+ students and restaurants around Eoeun-dong and Goong-dong in the city of Daejeon. Data about selected cafeterias and restaurants around the campus area were stored in the MySQL database.
